# Modular Test Stand

## What is this?
This is a simple and modular test rig to test hobby rocket motors. It is especially useful to measure homemade rocket motors and check their specs. It is constructed with a modular design in mind. This means that it can simply be converted to measure other forces for other tests.  
I'm neither a Physicist nor a Mechanical Engineer. I'm a Software Engineer. So take this with a grain of salt and feel free to make changes if necesarry.  
  
I just wanted to share my work in hopes that others may find it useful.
